Account-Management-Scripts
==========================
These are a few manual account management scripts that I complied on my last project.
If you aren't using LDAP or you can't use an automation framework like Puppet to push your account password changes, this collection of scripts should help.

Requirements
==========================
These scripts were written for RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.5/CentOS 6.5 but should work under other Linux distributions provied they use the same utilities.  Reivew the scripts before implementing.
