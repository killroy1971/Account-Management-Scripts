<H1>Account-Management-Scripts</H1>
==========================
<p>These are a few manual account management scripts that I complied on my last project.</br>
If you aren't using LDAP or you can't use an automation framework like Puppet to push your account password changes, this collection of scripts should help.</p>

<H2>Requirements</H2>
==========================
<p>These scripts were written for RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.5/CentOS 6.5 but should work under other Linux distributions provied they use the same utilities.  Reivew the scripts before implementing.</p>
